# figurex
Make figures with context managers in python: quicker, simpler, more readable.

# Examples

Make a simple plot:

```python
with Figure("A simple plot") as ax:
    ax.plot([1,2],[3,4])
```

A plot with two panels:
```python
with Figure(layout=(1,2), size=(6,3)):
    with Panel("a) Magic") as ax:
        ax.plot([1,2],[3,4])
    with Panel("b) Reality", grid="") as ax:
        ax.plot([5,5],[6,4])
```

Save a plot into memory for later use (e.g. in FPDF):
```python
with Figure("Tea party", save="memory") as memory:
    with Panel() as ax:
        ax.plot([5,5],[6,4])
memory
# <_io.BytesIO at 0x...>
```
